# Microtubule-Dynamic-Instability
 
Collection of scripts to determine the dynamic instability parameters of microtubules. 

### ImageJ macros
Two ImageJ macros to create kymographs from fluorescence microscopy images. 

### MatLab analysis
MatLab script "Dynamic_Instability.m" calculates the dynamic instability parameter, e.g. catastrophe frequency, as well as (EB) comet intensity. Requires the output from the ImageJ macros.
